Program 3: Malloc and Free Library Recreation

Programmers: Brennan Schmidt (bschmidt) and Peter Collins (pcollins)

This program is library that can replace the functionality of malloc and free.  It has three public functions that are used: Mem_Init, Mem_Alloc, and Mem_Free. Unlike traditional malloc and free which are dynamic, this implementation requests a static ammount of memory in the Mem_Init call which cannot be called more than once.  Then Mem_Alloc and Mem_Free work just like alloc and free as long as there is enough room from the initial requested size.

This library took a lot of work especially to pass all the tests.  For a long time we had a printf that affected the behavior of mmap, but it turns out we were corrupting the stack with some of our pointer logic.
